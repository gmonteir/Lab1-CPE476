Final Project
Author: Garrett Monteiro
--------------------------------

Scene includes texture mapping, a directional light, and randomly generated trees, as well as a cloud skybox.

Multiple point lights are also used.

Camera operates like a noclip camera. Hold down the left mouse button and move the mouse to look around. WASD to move.

I tried my best to get the water working, but it wasn't in the cards. Regardless, the code is still there.
